## How to make a guide
Perhaps the most important part of this website are the guides. The [Section Create Module](js/section-create.js) provides the tools for creating the guide and [pkmn.js](oak/emerald/living/pkmn.js) has an example for how to utilize it. 

Please also use [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for styling and minimize any other CSS.
